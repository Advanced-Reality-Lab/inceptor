## Inceptor Framework
Welcome to Inceptor, an open-source framework for creating interactive, narrative-driven scenes directly within the Unity editor. This project is designed to empower writers, narrative designers, and developers to build branching dialogues and dynamic stories with a simple, script-based workflow.

This repository is a monorepo containing all the core components of the Inceptor ecosystem.

### Core Components
The Inceptor framework is composed of three main projects, located in the packages directory:

- unity-inceptor: The core Unity package. It contains all the runtime logic and editor tools (like the Inceptor Wizard) needed to parse a cinematic script and generate a complete, playable Unity scene.

- clip-explorer-web: A modern, web-based authoring tool built with React. The Clip Explorer provides a visual, node-based interface for creating, editing, and visualizing the cinematic script JSON files that power the Unity package.

- docs: The official documentation website for the framework, built with Docusaurus. It contains "Getting Started" guides, tutorials on how to extend the framework, and core concept explanations.

### Getting Started
The best way to get started with the Inceptor framework is by visiting our official documentation website:

The documentation includes step-by-step tutorials that will guide you through installing the Unity package and creating your first interactive scene using the Inceptor Wizard.

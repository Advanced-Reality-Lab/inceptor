# Welcome to the Inceptor Framework
Creating dynamic, branching narratives with interactive characters in a 3D engine like Unity is a complex and time-consuming process. It often requires a deep understanding of animation state machines, scene management, UI programming, and scripting.

**The Inceptor Framework is designed to solve this problem.**

It is an open-source, code-free pipeline that empowers writers, researchers, and designers to transform a simple text script into a fully interactive 3D scene, quickly and efficiently.

## The Two Core Components
The framework is split into two main parts that work together to create a seamless workflow:

1. The Clip Explorer
A powerful, web-based visual editor where you create, manage, and export your narrative. It includes:

- A Text-to-JSON Converter to instantly turn a simple, dialogue-based script into a structured narrative file.

- A Visual Clip Map that allows you to see and manage the flow of your branching story at a glance.

- A Detailed Clip Editor for fine-tuning the properties of each scene and character interaction.

2. The Inceptor Unity Package
A lightweight and extensible package for the Unity Engine that reads the JSON files generated by the Clip Explorer and brings them to life. It handles all the complex underlying logic:

- Scene Generation: Automatically creates and configures characters, animators, and UI elements.

- Runtime Engine: Manages the flow of the cinematic, plays animations, and handles user input.

- Extensible Architecture: Designed to be easily extended with new types of clips, user inputs, and decision-making logic.

## Who is this for?
The Inceptor Framework is designed for anyone who wants to create interactive, character-driven experiences without getting bogged down in the technical complexities of a game engine. This includes:

- Narrative Designers & Writers: Focus purely on the story and dialogue.

- Researchers: Rapidly prototype and test interactive scenarios for studies in psychology, communication, and human-computer interaction.

- Unity Developers: Use the framework as a powerful foundation to quickly build and iterate on story-driven games and experiences.
